# 🛒 E-Commerce Pricing System - Java OOP Project

### 🚀 **Overview**
This project is a real-world **E-Commerce Pricing System** that demonstrates **Polymorphism** using **Method Overloading & Method Overriding** in Java. It calculates the price of different types of products (**Electronics, Clothing, Groceries**) based on category-specific pricing rules.

---

## 📌 **Features**
✅ Demonstrates **Method Overloading** (Price calculation with discount percentage).  
✅ Demonstrates **Method Overriding** (Different price calculations for different product types).  
✅ Implements **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
✅ **Scalable Design** – Easily extendable for new product categories.  
✅ **Real-World Relevance** – Similar pricing logic used in e-commerce platforms like **Amazon, Flipkart, eBay**.

🎯 Concepts Used
Method Overloading: Allows price calculation with or without a discount.
Method Overriding: Implements category-specific price calculations.
Encapsulation: Uses constructors and private attributes.
Abstraction: Hides implementation details behind simple method calls.
Inheritance: Product class is inherited by different product types.
🔥 Why This Project is Useful
✅ Industry-Relevant – E-commerce platforms use similar logic for pricing and discounts.
✅ Good for Interviews – Demonstrates Java OOP concepts clearly.
✅ Scalability – Easily extendable to support new product categories and pricing rules.
